#+TITLE:  Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Self-Organizing Maps
#+AUTHOR: Daniel Terra Gomes
#+Copyright: Diego Vicente Mart√≠n


This repository contains an implementation of a Self Organizing Map.

To run the code, only Python 3 and the dependencies (=matplotlib=, =numpy= and =pandas=,
which are included in the Anaconda distribution by default) are needed. In case
you are not using Anaconda, you can install all the dependencies with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

To run the code, simply execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd python src/main.py assets/<instance>.tsp
#+END_SRC

The images generated will be stored in the =diagrams= folder. Using a tool like
=convert=, you can easily generate an animation like the one in this file by
running:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert -delay 10 -loop 0 *.png animation.gif
#+END_SRC
